# Identifying

Each websocket connection needs to be identified to tell the server that it is a microservice. After identifying successfully, the server will send an idenitfied event. This will contain data about how/what a microservice should run, see [identified event data](payloads/#identified);

## Identify Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| type | string | type of microservice |
| compress | boolean | whether or not to zlib compress payloads |
| secret | string | secret api key to connect to the websocket, generated by oxyl developers so that fraud microservices are not connected |

Example payload data:

```json
{
	"type": "sharder",
	"compress": true,
	"secret": "736f948570f81074c2d3d9af56eac62db4"
}
